## Configure your .bashrc
Every time you start a new terminal, the file `~/.bashrc` will be sourced. When you already have an opened terminal, you can source it manually running this command

`source ~/.bashrc`

In order to use ROS, you need to source the ROS setup.bash file, therefore, it's recommended to include the previous command in your .bashrc file.

`echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`
